Course Description:
---

On October 8th, 2015, a team in Ecuador identified 431 species of birds – the world record for number counted in a single day. Earlier that year in Myanmar, a scientist counted one Jerdon’s babbler, the first in nearly eight decades. In December of 2019, eBird announced that its database held over 737 million bird observations. This morning, in Brooklyn Bridge park, I counted 38 house sparrows, 4 black-and-white warblers and an ovenbird. This course will consider birding as a practice, and will dive deep into the processes by which observations become data. As a collective, we will investigate how crowd-sourced data is transforming ornithology, and will explore ways to tell stories about the natural world through visualization and more radical forms of data representation.

## Expectations and Workload

You can expect to have a few assigned readings and videos to watch for each week. You must complete all readings prior to class, and come ready to participate in discussion. Details for how to submit assignments will be given in class.

## Grading

If we were using a percentage-based grading system, the numbers would look something like this:

Class participation: 30%
Assignments + Semester Projects: 70%
Since we’re not using a percentage-based grading system, let me put it another way: if you’re an active contributor to our discussions in class, and you complete your assignments, and you make something ambitious/excellent as a final project, you’ll pass this class. If you don’t, you won’t.

## Land Notice
Each week of this course, I'll be teaching from the unceded land of the Lenape and Canarsie peoples. I ask you to join me in acknowledging the Lenape and Canarsie communities, their elders both past and present, as well as future generations. I also acknowledge that NYU and ITP was founded upon exclusions and erasures of many Indigenous peoples, including those on whose land this institution is located. This acknowledgement demonstrates a commitment to beginning the process of working to dismantle the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism.

## This Syllabus is in Flux
And it will probably remain so for the rest of the course. I expect things to change as we get a sense of our shared goals, and an ideal pace of learning. Please check in here regularly.

## Class Rules

(i) Everyone does their best to show up to class on time. If you’re going to be late, let me know in advance. If you need to miss a class for any reason, you must also let me know in advance.

(ii) Everyone does the readings. For the most part, they’re short, fun, and useful.

(iii) All assignment work is due at the beginning of class. Everyone gets a free pass for one late assignment. After that, any assignments not ready for the start of class will be counted as incomplete.

(iv) Everyone in the class must attend office hours at least once in first four weeks of class.

(v) We’ll have a series of guest speakers coming into class over the course of the term. I will provide resources to learn about their work prior to their visits – everyone in class must do their homework and be prepared to learn from our guests.

(vi) I am 100% dedicated to a inclusive, harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, or religion. I will not tolerate harassment of class participants in any form. I will address you by your name and pronouns. Your health and well being is my first concern, and I will do my best not to add to the over-stressed conditions that programs like ITP unfortunately cultivate.

Class 1 - 3/23/23 - Class Intro + Birds & Data
------------

Birdwatching is closely bound to the enumeration of birds and the keeping of lists. In this class we'll examine several bird counting projects (past and present) and will use discussion about feeder-watching  to discuss what different methods of counting necessarily include and exclude. We'll also show a series of data visualizations and other artworks and interventaions based on bird data. 

- Introductions + class instructions
- Collaborative discussion on course goals + outcomes
- Why birding? Why birds? 


### Birding challenge:

Just get out there!

Tips for beginner birders:

- Find a eBird hotspot near you (https://ebird.org/hotspots) and see what has been seen recently. You don't have to go to that place, but the list should give you an idea of waht birds are currently around
- Look up these birds in advance. Watching videos and playing calls is very helpful. Remember, in the spring most birds will be singing.
- You don't have to travel far! Find a park (even a small one) or a wild area that's within comfortable walking distance and adopt it as your 'patch'.

Class 2 - 3/30/22 - Let's go birding!

### Birding challenge:

Watch one bird: Spend as much time as you can observing a single bird. What do you notice about its behaviour? 

## Small Assignment (Due Next Week):

Pick a bird data set (small or large) and produce a simple visualization of the data. Be prepared to share it in class next week. This could be built in Glitch or another software platform, or can be produced in any kind of physical media.

Class 4 - 4/13/23 - Calls & Songs
------------

Birding is as much an auditory experience as it is a visual one. Indeed, some behaviours of birds can only be observed by listening. In this class we'll focus on Nocturnal Flight Calls - the sounds that birds make when migrating high in the air at night. We'll look at techniques for DIY 'nocmig' recordings and will look at creative uses of sound in eco-focused creative practices.

### Week 1 of Final Project work

### Birding challenge: 

Eyes closed: Find a place in your patch where you can hear birds calling. Close your eyes for five or ten minutes and see how many different birds you can identify. Are there patterns in the way they are calling? 

Class 5 - 4/20/23 - Citizen Science
------------

On 9 May 2020, 50,000 birders submitted 120,000 checklists from 175 countries to eBird. Over the entire year, users of iNaturalist recorded 22.5M observations of 194,000 species. These data offer an invaluable resource to scientists, who are able to extend the range of their research by leaps and bounds. There are massive challenges inherent in these projects, though: how do you confirm that people are making the correct IDs? How do the biases of citizen scientists reflect in the data they collect and submit? How do you balance the goals of a citizen science project with the needs and preferences of 'users'?

### Week 2 of Final Project work

### Birding challenge: 

Walk the other way: pick a different spot to bird than you usually do, somewhere that might feel unfamilar to you. In what ways does this change the way you observe?

Class 6 - 4/27/23 - Satellites + Radar + Radio
------------

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/325363/110369004-bee1bc00-8017-11eb-8a38-b3058905ba0d.png)

Every day during the spring and fall migrations in North America, BirdCast provides real-time analysis maps showing intensities of actual nocturnal bird migration as detected by the US weather surveillance radar network between local sunset to sunrise. In adddition, it provides advance forecasts for migration in regions across the country. These forecasts are the product of a machine learning system trained on 23 years of bird movements in the atmosphere as detected by the US NEXRAD weather surveillance radar network. In this class we'll dig deep into the BirdCast system and learn how radar and radio is used to track birds in various contexts.

- Birds or bugs? https://twitter.com/radarandstuff/status/1043575880054988800

### Week 3 of Final Project work

### Birding challenge: 

Slow down: purposely walk at 1/2 of your usual pace. How does this shift your experience? Did you end up counting more or fewer birds?


Class 7 - 5/4/22 - Birding Backwards
------------

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/325363/110470995-91455300-80a9-11eb-8c8e-55639186f00f.png)

"Want to go birding at the museum?" 

In this class we'll look at how historical records can provide glimpses of the biodiversity of the past, and how narratives of collection and exploration are often anchored in colonialism and exploitation.
