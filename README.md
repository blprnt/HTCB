Course Description:
---

On October 8th, 2015, a team in Ecuador identified 431 species of birds – the world record for number counted in a single day. Earlier that year in Myanmar, a scientist counted one Jerdon’s babbler, the first in nearly eight decades. In December of 2019, eBird announced that its database held over 737 million bird observations. This morning, in Brooklyn Bridge park, I counted 38 house sparrows, 4 black-and-white warblers and an ovenbird. This course will consider birding as a practice, and will dive deep into the processes by which observations become data. As a collective, we will investigate how crowd-sourced data is transforming ornithology, and will explore ways to tell stories about the natural world through visualization and more radical forms of data representation.

## Expectations and Workload

You can expect to have a few assigned readings and videos to watch for each week. You must complete all readings prior to class, and come ready to participate in discussion. Details for how to submit assignments will be given in class.

## Grading

If we were using a percentage-based grading system, the numbers would look something like this:

Class participation: 30%
Assignments + Semester Projects: 70%
Since we’re not using a percentage-based grading system, let me put it another way: if you’re an active contributor to our discussions in class, and you complete your assignments, and you make something ambitious/excellent as a final project, you’ll pass this class. If you don’t, you won’t.

## Land Notice
Each week of this course, I'll be teaching from the unceded land of the Lenape and Canarsie peoples. I ask you to join me in acknowledging the Lenape and Canarsie communities, their elders both past and present, as well as future generations. I also acknowledge that NYU and ITP was founded upon exclusions and erasures of many Indigenous peoples, including those on whose land this institution is located. This acknowledgement demonstrates a commitment to beginning the process of working to dismantle the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism.

## This Syllabus is in Flux
And it will probably remain so for the rest of the course. I expect things to change as we get a sense of our shared goals, and an ideal pace of learning. Please check in here regularly.

## Class Rules

(i) Everyone does their best to show up to class on time. If you’re going to be late, let me know in advance. If you need to miss a class for any reason, you must also let me know in advance.

(ii) Everyone does the readings. For the most part, they’re short, fun, and useful.

(iii) All assignment work is due at the beginning of class. Everyone gets a free pass for one late assignment. After that, any assignments not ready for the start of class will be counted as incomplete.

(iv) Everyone in the class must attend office hours at least once in first four weeks of class.

(v) We’ll have a series of guest speakers coming into class over the course of the term. I will provide resources to learn about their work prior to their visits – everyone in class must do their homework and be prepared to learn from our guests.

(vi) I am 100% dedicated to a inclusive, harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, or religion. I will not tolerate harassment of class participants in any form. I will address you by your name and pronouns. Your health and well being is my first concern, and I will do my best not to add to the over-stressed conditions that programs like ITP unfortunately cultivate.
